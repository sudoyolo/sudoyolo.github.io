I'm an engineering senior at <a href="https://cic.du.ac.in">Cluster Innovation Centre,</a> <a href="https://www.du.ac.in">University of Delhi</a>, pursuing a Bachelors of Technology degree in IT and Math. I'm currently learning Deep Learning principles and its applications. 

I've previously worked at large-scale coroporations such as <a href="https://www.tatadigital.in">Tata Digital</a>. Most of my professional work revolves around <b>Computational Data Science</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>. However, my key interests are in the fields of <b>Natural Language Processing</b> and <b>Computer Vision</b>, specifically about their practical applications in Human-Computer Interaction (Eg. Voice Assistants such as Amazon Alexa). 

I like to talk about soccer (I aspire to maintain the same level of consistency in my professional career as Lionel Messi does on the soccer field), films and new technologies. In my free time, I try to volunteer for education. I have previously volunteered at the <a href="https://robinhoodarmy.com">Robin Hood Army NGO</a>, teaching underprivileged children Math and Science.
