The 5th iteration of Convoke, Convoke 5.0, was successfully organized at <a href="">Cluster Innovation Centre</a> at University of Delhi. Among other events such as Speed Cubing and Keyboard Wars, the fest's main attraction was Hashhacks, a 24 hour hackathon (with free coffee ofcourse), which received 500+ registrations!
