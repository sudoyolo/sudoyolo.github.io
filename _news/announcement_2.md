I'll be teaching Python to the freshers 2023. With many students hailing from a non-CS background, the course aims to cover the following:

<ul>
    <li>Introduction to Python: strings, lists, loops, recurssion, OOP.</li>
    <li>Python as a tool: Applications in Web Development, Data Engineering, ML and Research.</li>
    <li>Working with data: Introduction to pandas and visualizing data using matplotlib.</li>
    <li>Introduction to ML with scikit-learn.</li>
</ul>

Each session was 2 hours long. I took a total of 8+ hours of sessions. At the end of each session, students were asked to create a PR containing the work done in class in place of their attendance.
